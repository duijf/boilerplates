# Boilerplates

Boilerplate starter templates that I use from time to time.

These are geared for my personal use, but feel free to take from these
as you want.

## Boilerplates

 - `haskell-cli` - Haskell CLI tool.
 - `latex-doc` - LaTeX article with autoreload, and Nixified texlive
   environment.
