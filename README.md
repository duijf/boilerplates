# Boilerplates

Boilerplate starter templates that I use from time to time.

These are geared for my personal use, but feel free to take from these
as you want. They should sometimes show off how to accomplish certain
things.

## Features

 - Use Nix for the development environment.
 - No excessive dependencies.
 - Spend less time fiddling with project setup and get to the meat of
   your idea.

## Boilerplates

 - `haskell-cli` - Haskell CLI tool.
 - `latex-doc` - LaTeX article with autoreload, and Nixified texlive
   environment.

## License

Feel free to use the code in this repo under the MIT license.
